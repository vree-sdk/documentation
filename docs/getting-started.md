This chapter explains how to set up the development environment and how to get started with using the VRee Platform.


# Downloading and Importing the SDK

To get started using the VRee SDK for Unity, download the latest version of the SDK from the downloads page. Once the file has finished downloading, open `Unity 2017.4 LTS` or higher.

__Using Unity Package__  
In Unity, go to `Assets > Import Package > Custom Package…` and select the VRee SDK for Unity. Make sure that all files are selected by clicking on the `All` button in the bottom left corner before importing the package using the `Import` button.

__Using Example Project__  
Extract the folder to your preferred location and open it as a Unity project.

Navigate to the Prerequisites folder and unpack the `SoftwareActivation.7z` file. Run the `activateLicense.bat` batch file to active a blank xSens license.
Without this blank license Unity will appear to hang after clicking the play button with the VRee platform in the scene.  
__Please note:__ This is required even when __not__ using xSens hardware.

Drag the `[VReePlatform]` prefab from `VRee Platform\Prefabs\` into the scene, or open the provided example scene.


# Generating a License

In order to use the VRee SDK for Unity, a valid license has to be installed on the machine. A VRee license is built using license keys. A license key can be generated by going to `VRee > Generate License…` which opens up the VRee License generation window. By follow the Usage instructions on this window, a license key is requested and a VRee license is automatically generated.

# Preparing the Development Environment

The VRee SDK requires a number of run-time components of the C++ libraries have to be installed. The `C++ 2015 Redistributable` can be downloaded from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53840).

Additionally, in order to correctly send and receive multiplayer data, a firewall exception rule has to be added for Unity. This exception allows the SDK to communicate with players on the same network.


# Selecting the Target Hardware

When building the application from Unity, the VRee SDK needs to know on what hardware the application will run on. These hardware targets can be changed in the `VRee > Settings` window.

Select the Target HMD from the 'HMD Build targets'.

The settings are usable for the following hardware:
__3DOFDefault__  
Can be used for any 3DOF headset that put's its rotational data onto Unity's Camera object.
__Standalone__

Then select all hardware the users will be using.

# Building the Application

To build the server application, make sure `VRee Settings > Networking Roles > Windows Role` is set to `Server`. Next, navigate to `File > Build Settings...` to open the Build Settings. Set the platform to `PC, Mac & Linux Standalone` and set the `Architecture` to `x86_64`. Finally, press `Builld` to start building the server application.

## Windows Client

For HTC Vive, Oculus Rift and other Windows Clients, set the `VRee Settings > Networking Roles > Windows Role` to `Client` and follow the build steps above.

## Android Client

For GearVR, HTC Focus and other Android Clients, set the `VRee Settings > Networking Roles > Android Role` to `Client`. Next, navigate to `File > Build Settings...` to open the Build Settings. Set the platform to `Android`. Finally, press `Build` to start building the client application.

# Running the application

Start both the client and server application, and wait for the client to connect.
While connecting the client's screen will remain black.

As soon as the connection is established the client will be visible on the server's UI, and a client side camera will be created.

__Note:__ It's recommended to run the server and client on seperate systems. Unexpected behaviour may occur while running both applications on the same systems.
