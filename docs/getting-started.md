This chapter explains how to set up the development environment and how to get started with using the VRee Platform.


# Downloading and Importing the SDK

To get started using the VRee SDK for Unity, download the latest version of the SDK from the downloads page. Once the file has finished downloading, open `Unity 2017.4 LTS` or higher to import the SDK.

In Unity, go to `Assets > Import Package > Custom Package…` and select the VRee SDK for Unity. Make sure that all files are selected by clicking on the `All` button in the bottom left corner before importing the package using the `Import` button.

Drag the `[VReePlatform]` prefab from `VRee Platform\Prefabs\` into the scene, or open the provided example scene.


# Generating a License

In order to use the VRee SDK for Unity, a valid license has to be installed on the machine. A VRee license is built using license keys. A license key can be generated by going to `VRee > Generate License…` which opens up the VRee License generation window. By follow the Usage instructions on this window, a license key is requested and a VRee license is automatically generated.


# Preparing the Development Environment

The VRee SDK requires a number of run-time components of the C++ libraries have to be installed. The `C++ 2015 Redistributable` can be downloaded from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53840).

Additionally, in order to correctly send and receive multiplayer data, a firewall exception rule has to be added for Unity. This exception allows the SDK to communicate with players on the same network.


# Selecting the Target Hardware

When building the application from Unity, the VRee SDK needs to know on what hardware the application will run on. These hardware targets can be changed in the `VRee > Settings` window.

Select the Target HMD from the 'HMD Build targets'.

Then select all hardware the users will be using.

# Building the Application

To build the server application, make sure `VRee Settings > Networking Roles > Windows Role` is set to `Server`. Next, navigate to `File > Build Settings...` to open the Build Settings. Set the platform to `PC, Mac & Linux Standalone` and set the `Architecture` to `x86_64`. Finally, press `Builld` to start building the server application.

## Windows Client

For HTC Vive, Oculus Rift and other Windows Clients, set the `VRee Settings > Networking Roles > Windows Role` to `Client` and follow the build steps above.
