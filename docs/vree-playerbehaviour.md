# VReePlayerBehaviour

The `VReePlayerBehaviour` script extends the standard Unity `MonoBehaviour` with useful features when developing with the VRee SDK. When a VReePlayerBehaviour is attached to a player, it automatically receives the `Player` reference on which they are attached.

## Creation

The VReePlayerBehaviour can be created by right-clicking in the Project window and selecting `Create > VRee > VReePlayerBehaviour Script`. Alternatively, a script can extend `VReePlayerBehaviour`.
